   - Click **Run workflow**, and you can choose the branch to execute it against.

4. **Monitor the Execution**:
   - The workflow execution progress will be displayed in real time, similar to the screenshot you provided.
   - You will see logs for each step, such as:
     - **Set up job**: Preparing the runner environment.
     - **Print Greeting**: Executing `echo "Hello World!"`.
     - **Print Goodbye**: Executing `echo "Done - bye!"`.
