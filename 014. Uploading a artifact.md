### Explanation of Job Artifact Upload Using the Example

In your workflow, the **artifact upload process** ensures that the build outputs (like the website files) can be saved for later use, either for manual download or as inputs for other jobs in the same workflow. Letâ€™s break down the relevant parts of your example:

### Key Section for Artifact Upload

```yaml
  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build Website
        run: npm run build

      - name: Upload Build Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: website-assets
          path: |
            dist          # Include the built website files
            package.json  # Include additional files if needed
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

#### 1. **Build Website**
- **Command**: `npm run build`
- **Purpose**: This step generates the website's production-ready files, typically placed in the `dist/` directory.

#### 2. **Upload Build Artifacts**
- **Command**: Uses the `actions/upload-artifact` action.
- **Purpose**: This step uploads the generated files (`dist/` directory and `package.json`) as a named artifact (`website-assets`).
  
#### **Key Parameters in `upload-artifact`:**
- **`name: website-assets`**:
  - This is the identifier for the uploaded artifact. It allows you to reference the artifact in other jobs or download it manually later.
- **`path`**:
  - Specifies the files or directories to be included in the artifact.
  - In this example:
    - `dist`: Contains the built website files (HTML, CSS, JS).
    - `package.json`: Included for any configuration or metadata purposes.

### What Happens After Artifact Upload?

1. **Artifact Storage**:
   - The artifact (`website-assets`) is stored temporarily in GitHub Actions. By default, artifacts are retained for **90 days**, but this can be configured with `retention-days`.

2. **Manual Download**:
   - After the workflow completes, the artifact can be downloaded manually from the **Artifacts** section of the GitHub Actions run page.

3. **Use in Other Jobs**:
   - Artifacts can be shared between jobs within the same workflow by downloading them in subsequent jobs using `actions/download-artifact`.

### Sharing Artifacts Between Jobs

If you have another job (e.g., a `deploy` job) that needs to use the `website-assets`, you can include the following in the subsequent job:

#### Example of Using Artifacts in Another Job

```yaml
  deploy:
    needs: build  # Ensures 'build' job completes first
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download Build Artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: website-assets  # Matches the name used in the upload step

      - name: Deploy Website
        run: |
          echo "Deploying files from the downloaded artifact..."
          ls dist
```

### Benefits of Using Job Artifacts

1. **Persistent Outputs**:
   - Artifacts ensure that outputs from one job (like build files) are available for further use.

2. **Workflow Modularity**:
   - Separates the responsibilities of testing, building, and deploying into distinct jobs.

3. **Reusability**:
   - Artifacts allow for easy reuse of build outputs in other jobs or workflows.

4. **Debugging**:
   - Provides a way to inspect outputs like logs or build files in case of failures.

### Summary

In this example:
- The `build` job generates website files and uploads them as artifacts named `website-assets`.
- Artifacts are stored temporarily and can be:
  1. Downloaded manually after the workflow run.
  2. Used in subsequent jobs (like a deployment job).

This approach is essential for workflows that involve multiple stages, where outputs from one stage serve as inputs for the next. Let me know if you'd like to extend this workflow with deployment steps!
