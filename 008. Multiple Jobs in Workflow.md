### Multiple Jobs in a Workflow

Note : Each Job wil run on a seprate runner, unaware of each other, that why we have install dependencies on both runner.

GitHub Actions workflows can contain multiple **jobs**. By default, these jobs run **in parallel**, but you can configure dependencies to make them run **sequentially** if needed.

---

### Example Workflow: `Deploy Project`

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of your workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy Project

on: push

jobs:
  # Job 1: Testing
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Get Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install NodeJS
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test

  # Job 2: Deployment
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Get Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install NodeJS
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build Project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy Project
        run: echo "Deploying Project"
```

---

### Key Features in This Workflow

1. **Parallel Execution**:
   - Both `test` and `deploy` jobs run simultaneously because no dependency is defined between them.

2. **Reusable Steps**:
   - Both jobs clone the code and set up the Node.js environment. This is a common pattern when jobs need a clean environment to start.

---

### Running Jobs Sequentially

To make jobs run **sequentially**, you can use the `needs` keyword. For example, if the `deploy` job depends on the `test` job completing successfully:

```yaml
name: Deploy Project

on: push

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Get Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install NodeJS
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test

  deploy:
    needs: test # Ensures 'deploy' runs after 'test'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Get Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install NodeJS
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build Project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy Project
        run: echo "Deploying Project"
```

---

### Explanation of `needs`

- The `needs` keyword ensures that the `deploy` job will only start after the `test` job completes successfully.
- If the `test` job fails, the `deploy` job will be skipped.

---

### Summary

- Use multiple jobs for modular workflows, especially when tasks can run independently.
- Jobs run in parallel by default, but you can sequence them using the `needs` keyword.
- Reuse steps across jobs to avoid redundancy, and ensure each job starts with a clean setup.
