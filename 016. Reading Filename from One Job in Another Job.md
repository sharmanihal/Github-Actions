        run: echo ${{ needs.build.outputs.script-file }}

```

### **How the File Name is Passed from One Job to Another**

1. **Setting an Output in the `build` Job**:
   - In the `build` job, the `Public JS Filename` step identifies a JavaScript file in the `dist/assets/` directory using the `find` command.
   - The `::set-output` command sets a job-level output variable named `script-file-name`.
     ```bash
     ::set-output name=script-file-name::{}
     ```
     - Here, `{}` is replaced with the filename found by the `find` command.

2. **Defining Job-Level Outputs**:
   - The `outputs` section in the `build` job defines a job-level output named `script-file`.
     ```yaml
     outputs:
       script-file: ${{ steps.public-js-filename.outputs.script-file-name }}
     ```
   - This maps the step output `script-file-name` to the job output `script-file`.
   - The `steps.public-js-filename.outputs.script-file-name` syntax accesses the output set by the step with the ID `public-js-filename`.

3. **Accessing the Output in the `deploy` Job**:
   - The `deploy` job depends on the `build` job (`needs: build`), which ensures it can access the `build` job's outputs.
   - The `build` job's output is accessed using the syntax:
     ```bash
     ${{ needs.build.outputs.script-file }}
     ```
   - This retrieves the filename set by the `build` job and makes it available for use in the `deploy` job.

### **Detailed Workflow Breakdown**

#### `build` Job:
- **Purpose**: Find a specific JavaScript file and expose its filename as a job output.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Use the `find` command to locate a `.js` file in the `dist/assets/` directory.
  2. Use the `::set-output` command to set the filename as a step output.
  3. Define the `script-file` job output to pass this value to subsequent jobs.

#### `deploy` Job:
- **Purpose**: Access the filename identified in the `build` job.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Declare `needs: build` to depend on the `build` job.
  2. Access the `build` job's output using `needs.build.outputs.script-file`.

---

### **Example Output**

- Suppose the `find` command in the `build` job locates a file named `app.js` in the `dist/assets/` directory. 
- The `build` job sets this filename (`dist/assets/app.js`) as the `script-file` output.
- In the `deploy` job, this value is printed with:
  ```bash
  echo ${{ needs.build.outputs.script-file }}
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  dist/assets/app.js
  ```

### **Why This Workflow is Useful**
1. **Decoupling Tasks**:
   - Allows the `build` job to handle file discovery and the `deploy` job to focus on deployment using the identified file.
2. **Dynamic File Handling**:
   - Handles scenarios where file names are generated dynamically during a workflow.
3. **Improved Modularity**:
   - Simplifies workflows by allowing jobs to share critical information through outputs.
