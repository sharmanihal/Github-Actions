### Steps to Create a Custom GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Navigate to the Actions Tab**:  
   Go to your GitHub repository and click on the **Actions** tab.

2. **Start with a Simple Workflow**:  
   Click **Configure** under the "Simple Workflow" option. This opens a template YAML file.

3. **Customize the YAML File**:
   - Delete the existing template content.
   - Add your own workflow configuration to understand the structure and functionality.

4. **Save the Workflow File**:
   - The name of the workflow is determined by the YAML file's name.
   - Save the file in the path:  
     ```
     repo > .github > workflows > your-workflow-name.yml
     ```

### Example Workflow Configuration

Here's an example of a simple workflow:

```yaml
name: First Workflow

on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  first-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Print Greeting
        run: echo "Hello World!"
      - name: Print Goodbye
        run: echo "Done - bye!"
```

### Explanation of the Workflow Components:

1. **`name:`**  
   This specifies the name of the workflow (displayed in the Actions tab).

2. **`on:`**  
   - Specifies the event that triggers the workflow.  
   - `workflow_dispatch` allows manual triggering from the GitHub UI.

3. **`jobs:`**  
   - A workflow can have multiple jobs. Each job has a unique identifier (e.g., `first-job`).

4. **`runs-on:`**  
   - Defines the environment for the job.  
   - In this example, `ubuntu-latest` is the runner (a virtual machine with Ubuntu).

5. **`steps:`**  
   - Each job contains steps, executed sequentially.
   - Steps use the format:
     - **`- name:`**: A descriptive name for the step.
     - **`run:`**: The command or script to execute in this step.

### Example Steps Breakdown:
1. **Print Greeting**:  
   ```yaml
   - name: Print Greeting
     run: echo "Hello World!"
   ```
   Outputs "Hello World!" to the console.

2. **Print Goodbye**:  
   ```yaml
   - name: Print Goodbye
     run: echo "Done - bye!"
   ```
   Outputs "Done - bye!" to the console.

### Tip for Runners:
To explore available runners, search for "GitHub Actions runners" on Google. For now, `ubuntu-latest` is a widely used default.
