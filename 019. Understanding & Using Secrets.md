To now access these secrets in your github workflow you can make use of the "secrets" context object.

```yml
jobs:
  test:
    env:
      MONGODB_CLUSTER_ADDRESS: cluster0.kvt3a.mongodb.net
      MONGODB_USERNAME: ${{secrets.MONGODB_USERNAME}}
      MONGODB_PASSWORD: ${{secrets.MONGODB_PASSWORD}}
```
