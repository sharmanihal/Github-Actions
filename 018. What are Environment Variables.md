### **Environment Variables in GitHub Actions: Explanation Using the Example**

Environment variables are key-value pairs that store configuration values used in workflows. They can be defined globally, per-job, or specific to certain steps. Here's how they are used in the provided example:

---

### **Types of Environment Variables in the Workflow**

1. **Global Environment Variables**
   ```yaml
   env:
     MONGODB_DB_NAME: gha-demo
   ```
   - **Scope**: These variables are defined at the top level of the workflow file and are accessible in all jobs.
   - **Example in Workflow**:
     - The variable `MONGODB_DB_NAME` is set globally to `gha-demo` and is accessible in both the `test` and `deploy` jobs.

2. **Job-Specific Environment Variables**
   ```yaml
   env:
     MONGODB_CLUSTER_ADDRESS: cluster0.kvt3a.mongodb.net
     MONGODB_USERNAME: abc
     MONGODB_PASSWORD: FrI6s9scEAwTCMzS
     PORT: 8080
   ```
   - **Scope**: These variables are defined within the `test` job and are available only in that job.
   - **Purpose**: Used for test configuration, such as MongoDB connection details and server port.
   - **Example in Workflow**:
     - Variables like `MONGODB_CLUSTER_ADDRESS`, `MONGODB_USERNAME`, `MONGODB_PASSWORD`, and `PORT` are specific to the `test` job and not accessible in the `deploy` job.

3. **Environment Variable Outputs**
   ```yaml
   run: echo "MONDODB_DB_NAME=${{ env.MONGODB_DB_NAME }}"
   ```
   - Variables can be referenced using `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}`.
   - In shell commands, they are referenced with `$VARIABLE_NAME`.

### **Key Workflow Details**

1. **Global Variable Usage in Jobs**:
   - The variable `MONGODB_DB_NAME` is defined globally and used in both jobs.
   - In the `test` job:
     ```yaml
     - name: Output information
       run: echo "MONDODB_DB_NAME=${{ env.MONGODB_DB_NAME }}"
     ```
   - In the `deploy` job:
     ```yaml
     - name: Output information
       run: |
         echo "MONDODB_DB_NAME=${{ env.MONGODB_DB_NAME }}"
         echo "MONDODB_DB_NAME= $MONGODB_DB_NAME"
     ```

2. **Job-Specific Variable Usage**:
   - The `test` job defines its own environment variables (e.g., `MONGODB_CLUSTER_ADDRESS`, `MONGODB_USERNAME`).
   - These variables are used for starting a server and running tests.

3. **Passing Information Between Jobs**:
   - Global environment variables like `MONGODB_DB_NAME` are accessible across jobs without needing to explicitly pass them.
   - For job-specific variables, you need to output them and explicitly pass them if required in subsequent jobs.

### **Notes on Environment Variables**

1. **Priority**:
   - Job-level variables override global variables with the same name.
   - Step-level variables (if defined) override both.

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - Avoid storing sensitive information (like `MONGODB_PASSWORD`) directly in the workflow.
   - Use GitHub Secrets for secure storage:
     ```yaml
     env:
       MONGODB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.MONGODB_PASSWORD }}
     ```

3. **Referencing Variables**:
   - Use `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}` in workflow syntax.
   - Use `$VARIABLE_NAME` in shell scripts.

4. **Global Consistency**:
   - Global variables like `MONGODB_DB_NAME` ensure consistency across jobs while reducing redundancy.

---

### **Example Output for `deploy` Job**

When the `deploy` job runs, the `Output information` step will output:

```
MONDODB_DB_NAME=gha-demo
MONDODB_DB_NAME= gha-demo
```

### **Benefits of Using Environment Variables**

1. **Reusability**:
   - Simplifies workflows by storing configuration values in one place.
   
2. **Flexibility**:
   - Allows customization for different jobs, branches, or workflows.

3. **Security**:
   - Use with GitHub Secrets to securely handle sensitive data.

4. **Readability**:
   - Makes workflows easier to maintain and understand.
