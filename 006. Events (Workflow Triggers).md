### Workflow Triggers in GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions allows workflows to be triggered by various events. For example:

1. **Manual Trigger**: 
   - **`workflow_dispatch`**: This allows a workflow to be triggered manually through the GitHub interface.
   - This is ideal for workflows that you want to run on demand, such as deployment or maintenance scripts.

2. **Event-Based Triggers**:
   - You can trigger workflows automatically based on specific Git events like:
     - **`push`**: Triggered when changes are pushed to a branch.
     - **`pull_request`**: Triggered on pull request actions, like opening, closing, or merging a pull request.
   - These triggers can be fine-tuned. For instance:
     - Restrict the trigger to specific branches (`branches` or `branches-ignore`).
     - Target specific paths or tags.

### Example Workflow with a `push` Trigger

Below is an example workflow configuration using the `push` event trigger:

```yaml
name: Test Project

# Trigger workflow on 'push' to specific branches
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - development # Trigger only on 'main' and 'development' branches

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Check out the code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Run a simple script
      - name: Run tests
        run: echo "Running tests for pushed changes"
```

### Fine-Grained Control for Triggers
Using the `push` trigger, you can define conditions like:
- **Targeted Branches**:
  - `branches`: Specify branches to include.
  - `branches-ignore`: Specify branches to exclude.
- **Targeted Paths**:
  - `paths`: Trigger workflows only when changes affect specific files or directories.
  - `paths-ignore`: Ignore specific paths.

#### Example with `paths`:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'src/**' # Trigger only if changes are made in the 'src' directory
      - '!docs/**' # Exclude changes in the 'docs' directory
```
