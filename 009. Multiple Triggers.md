Yes, GitHub Actions workflows can be triggered by multiple events. By defining multiple triggers, you can make your workflow run under different conditions, such as when code is pushed to the repository or when a manual trigger is activated.

---

### Example: Multiple Triggers in a Workflow

Hereâ€™s a refined example based on your input:

```yaml
name: Deploy Project

on:
  # Trigger workflow on push and manual dispatch
  push: # Trigger on any push to the repository
    branches:
      - main # Only run on pushes to the 'main' branch
      - development # And the 'development' branch
  workflow_dispatch: # Enable manual triggering

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Get Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install NodeJS
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test

  deploy:
    needs: test # Run this job after 'test'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Get Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install NodeJS
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build Project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy Project
        run: echo "Deploying Project"
```

### Explanation

1. **Triggers Defined in `on`**:
   - **`push`**: Runs the workflow automatically when code is pushed to the specified branches (`main` and `development` in this case).
   - **`workflow_dispatch`**: Enables manual execution of the workflow via the GitHub Actions interface.

2. **Job Sequencing**:
   - The `deploy` job depends on the `test` job (`needs: test`). This ensures that `deploy` only runs after the `test` job is completed successfully.

3. **Flexible Workflow Execution**:
   - You can either push changes to trigger the workflow or run it manually when needed using `workflow_dispatch`.

### Advantages of Multiple Triggers

1. **Automation and Flexibility**:
   - Automated runs on events like `push` ensure that workflows are triggered consistently.
   - Manual runs via `workflow_dispatch` allow for ad-hoc testing or deployment.

2. **Environment-Specific Runs**:
   - You can combine triggers with inputs (for manual dispatch) to allow for flexible workflows. For example, during a manual run, you might pass parameters like environment (e.g., production, staging).

---

### Example with Inputs for Manual Trigger

To add inputs for the `workflow_dispatch` event:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Deployment environment'
        required: true
        default: 'staging'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy Project
        run: echo "Deploying to ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }} environment"
```

Here, the `workflow_dispatch` event prompts you to choose the environment before triggering the workflow manually.
