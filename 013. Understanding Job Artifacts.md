## Job Artifacts

When a job builds an application, it typically generates outputs such as `.exe` files, binary files, or website assets that need to be uploaded to an application server or used in subsequent steps. These outputs are referred to as **job artifacts** in GitHub Actions. Artifacts can be saved and uploaded during the workflow execution, allowing them to be downloaded manually for further use or shared across jobs within the same workflow. This functionality simplifies tasks like deploying build outputs or analyzing generated files, ensuring they are easily accessible whenever needed.
