### Using `run` Commands and Actions in GitHub Workflows

When you define steps in a GitHub Actions workflow, the `run` option lets you execute shell commands on the runner. However, it's important to note that the runner is a clean environment—it doesn’t have access to your code by default.

To interact with your codebase or perform tasks requiring specific dependencies, you must **set up the environment** first. This is where **actions** come in handy. Actions are reusable units of code that simplify workflow automation.

### Types of Actions

1. **Community-Driven Actions**:
   - Prebuilt actions available in the GitHub Actions **Marketplace**.
   - Example: [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout) is a popular community action to clone your code repository onto the runner.

2. **Custom Actions**:
   - You can create your own actions tailored to your specific needs, such as scripts or tools unique to your project.

### Example Workflow with Actions and Commands

Here’s an example workflow where we use both community-driven actions and custom commands:

```yaml
name: Test Project

on: push

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Clone the repository onto the runner
      - name: Get Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js (specific version)
      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies using npm
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run tests
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
```

### Explanation of Steps

1. **`actions/checkout`**:
   - This action clones your repository into the runner's workspace so the subsequent steps can access the codebase.
   - Marketplace link: [actions/checkout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout)

2. **`actions/setup-node`**:
   - Installs a specific version of Node.js on the runner, enabling you to run Node.js-based commands.
   - Marketplace link: [actions/setup-node](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-node)

3. **`run` Commands**:
   - `npm ci`: Installs project dependencies defined in the `package.json` file using the clean install mode.
   - `npm test`: Runs tests defined in your project.

---

### Key Points

- **Actions** simplify repetitive tasks (like cloning code or setting up environments).
- Use `run` to execute custom shell commands for project-specific tasks.
- Combine actions and commands to create powerful workflows.

This setup allows your workflow to prepare a runner, install dependencies, and execute tests with minimal manual intervention. Let me know if you'd like to explore advanced configurations or custom actions!
